First flow the first three steps in "Getting Started" part

If you've downloaded the source code you can also run the aligner as a command line program:

python3 align.py audio.mp3 words.txt

However, It shows “no resource directory”.


Then you have to copy the exp directory into the path where you save the source code

cp -r /Volumes/Gentle/gentle.app/Contents/Resources/exp/  $source code directory
